# CPM

CPM is an open-source program on large-scale pre-trained models, which is conducted by Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and Tsinghua University, with the goal of building large-scale Chinese-centered pre-trained models. The open-source models can be widely used in Chinese natural language understanding, generative tasks, and all of them are free and open for download for research use.
